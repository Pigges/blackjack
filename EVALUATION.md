# Evaluation of 'Blackjack en Python'

After being done with this project, I can't say that anything have been particularly hard.
But on that note, I didn't completely follow my plan.
I realized later that I didn't need all methods that I originally planned to be using.

First, I planned to be having the main game loop altogether in the Game class.
But I decided to just reference a function in the main.py file so that the class files wouldn't become as cluttered.

A plan from the beginning was to make the code as modular as possible, and I would say that I have succeeded with this relatively well.
There are no too big file containing a lot of code which would make it hard to read through.
